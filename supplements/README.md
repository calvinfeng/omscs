## Computer Networks and Internet

### Network Edge

The edge refers to the end systems of a computer network. In most cases, they are servers and client
programs. However, access networks are another common "edges". They are the physical links that
connect an end system to the first router, also known as the edge router. Many of the access technologies
employ portions of the traditional local wired telephone infrastructure. The local wired telephone
infrastructure is provided by a local telephone provider, which we will simply refer as the local
**telco**.
